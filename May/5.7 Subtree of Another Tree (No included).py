    Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with
     a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants.
     The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Example :
    Given tree s:

         3
        / \
       4   5
      / \
     1   2
    Given tree t:
       4
      / \
     1   2
    Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.

    Given tree s:

         3
        / \
       4   5
      / \
     1   2
        /
       0
    Given tree t:
       4
      / \
     1   2
    Return false.
